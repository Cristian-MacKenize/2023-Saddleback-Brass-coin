# 2023-Saddleback-Brass-coin
A brass coin I made in the spring semester of 2023
The coin was modelled and programed in mastercam, the coin was machined on a tormach 770M
The coin was a project where we were given instruction on the side with the school logo then with what we learned, we took that and made something on the otherside ourselves
